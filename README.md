# Getting Started : Gitter Susi AI Bot Installation 

Create a github or twitter account with a username having 'Susi' as its substring. Because this is the name that will be shown with the reply string we will get from Susi AI. 

Now you need to sign in to Gitter with a twitter or github account from [here](https://gitter.im). 

We will be using the streaming API of Gitter to deploy SUSI chat bot to Gitter. You can read the [documentation](https://developer.gitter.im/docs/streaming-api) and get familiar with the API.

## Prerequisites
To create your account on -:
1. Github
2. Gitter
3. Heroku

## Setup your own Messenger Bot
1. Fork this repository.

2. Create your community by visiting this [page](https://gitter.im/home/explore#createcommunity). After writing your community name press next, invite the people you want to be in this room and press next. You will be redirected to your communities lobby. This lobby is the chat room to which we will deploy our SUSI AI.

3. Now visit the gitter developer [page](https://developer.gitter.im/docs/welcome), press sign in on the top right. You will be redirected to your apps page. Copy the personal access token written there.

4. On a new tab, in your browser visit https://api.gitter.im/v1/rooms?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN, with YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN replaced by the token we just copied. 
A JSON object will be shown on our browser screen. You will see the value of 'name' key as YOUR_COMMUNITY_NAME/Lobby. Copy the id of this chat room, as we will need it later. You can refer to the image below, you will have your chat room id in the area coloured black.

 This app will accept the requests from Gitter and Susi api.
